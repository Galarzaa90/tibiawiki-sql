| notes         = Mainly used from [[level]] 30 to 35 by [[Knight]]s. This sword is also used by higher level Knights to fight creatures immune to [[Physical Damage]], like [[Ghost]]s. Provides a small amount of red light. The graphic for the Fire Sword is an edit of the old [[Rapier]] sprite.
{{JSpoiler|
* Can be obtained in the [[Orc Fortress Quest]].
* 3 Fire Swords can be traded for a [[Magic Sulphur]] with [[Haroun]] or [[Yaman]].

| history       = Before [[Updates/7.2|Update 7.2]] the Fire Sword was the best easy-obtainable one handed sword on all [[Game World]]s but [[Antica]]. It was possible to inflict two rounds of damage at a time because of its weight.

== Earlier ways of obtaining ==
[[Dragon]]s used to drop these [[sword]]s. Long ago they were also obtainable from a [[quest]] [[A Sweaty Cyclops]] was part of.

== Sprite Change ==
With the [[Updates/9.5|2012 Spring Patch]] the sprite of the Fire Sword changed from [[File:Fire Sword (Old).gif]] to [[File:Fire Sword.gif]].
